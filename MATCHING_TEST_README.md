# 🧪 Simple Matching Test Suite

Multiple test scripts to verify that the matching functionality is working correctly.

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### 🏃‍♂️ Quick Test (No Dependencies)
**Ultra-simple logic test - works immediately**
- Double-click `run_simple_test.bat` 
- OR: `dart simple_test.dart`

### 🔥 Firebase Simulation Test  
**Tests Firebase workflow without real Firebase**
- `dart test_firebase_only.dart`

### 📱 Full Flutter + Firebase Test
**Complete integration test (requires Flutter working)**
- Double-click `run_matching_test.bat` 
- OR: Right-click `run_matching_test.ps1` → "Run with PowerShell"
- OR: `dart test_matching_simple.dart`

## 📋 What It Tests

### ✅ Test 1: Basic Matching
- Creates 2 users with same mom stage ("pregnant?")
- Both users are active and waiting
- Verifies they can successfully match

### ✅ Test 2: Active User Filtering  
- Creates 1 active user and 1 inactive user
- Verifies only active users are matched
- Inactive users (old timestamp) are filtered out

### ✅ Test 3: No Match Scenario
- Creates 1 lonely user
- Verifies system correctly returns "no match" when no one else is waiting

🧪 Running Matching Tests...

📋 Test 1: Basic Matching with Same Stages
----------------------------------------
👤 Created User1: test_user_1234567890_123
👤 Created User2: test_user_1234567890_456  
⏳ Both users marked as active and waiting
✅ Match found successfully!
🤝 Matched with: TestUser2
📊 Match ID: abc123def456

📋 Test 2: Active User Filtering
----------------------------------------
👤 Created Active User: test_user_1234567890_789
👤 Created Inactive User: test_user_1234567890_012
⏳ Active user marked as recently active
🕐 Inactive user marked with old timestamp
✅ Correctly filtered out inactive users!

📋 Test 3: No Match Scenario  
----------------------------------------
👤 Created Lonely User: test_user_1234567890_345
⏳ User marked as active and waiting
✅ Correctly returned no match when alone!

🧹 Cleaning up test data...
✨ Cleanup completed

✅ All tests completed!
🎉 Matching system is working correctly!
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you get errors:
1. Make sure Flutter is installed: `flutter doctor`
2. Make sure you're in the `v1_mother_edition` folder
3. Make sure Firebase is configured properly
4. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies

## 🎯 What This Proves

- ✅ Matching algorithm works
- ✅ Active user filtering works  
- ✅ Database operations work
- ✅ No false matches occur
- ✅ Cleanup works properly
