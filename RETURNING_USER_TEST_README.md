# Returning User Flow Test

This test script validates the core logic of the returning user flow in the Mother Connection Platform using pure Dart logic simulation, ensuring that the decision-making and flow logic works correctly.

## What It Tests

### ðŸ”„ Complete Returning User Journey
1. **App Initialization**: Tests that returning users are properly remembered and authenticated
2. **Login Process**: Validates pre-filled username and "Remember Me" functionality  
3. **Navigation Flow**: Ensures users skip stage selection and go directly to challenges
4. **Challenges Completion**: Tests that question sets can be saved and validated
5. **Dashboard Access**: Verifies users reach dashboard after completing onboarding
6. **Integration Flow**: Full end-to-end test of the complete returning user experience

### ðŸ§ª Test Cases Covered

#### Test 1: App Initialization with Remembered User
- Creates user with "Remember Me" enabled
- Simulates partial onboarding state
- Verifies user is remembered between sessions
- Confirms onboarding status detection

#### Test 2: Login Process with Pre-filled Data  
- Tests sign out and sign in flow
- Validates remembered username functionality
- Confirms authentication state management

#### Test 3: Skip Stage Selection Logic
- Verifies returning users bypass stage selection
- Tests navigation logic for authenticated but incomplete users
- Confirms proper flow routing

#### Test 4: Challenges Completion Flow
- Simulates completing question sets
- Tests data persistence to Firebase
- Validates question storage and retrieval

#### Test 5: Final Navigation to Dashboard
- Confirms onboarding completion detection
- Tests user data completeness validation
- Verifies dashboard access logic

#### Test 6: Complete Flow Integration Test
- End-to-end test of entire returning user journey
- Tests app restart scenarios
- Validates persistent authentication and data

## How to Run

### Windows (Batch)
```bash
run_returning_user_test.bat
```

### Windows/Mac/Linux (PowerShell)
```bash
./run_returning_user_test.ps1
```

### Direct Dart Execution
```bash
dart test_returning_user_flow.dart
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Dart SDK**: Ensure Dart is installed and available in your PATH
2. **Working Directory**: Run from the `v1_mother_edition` folder
3. **No Dependencies**: This is a pure Dart test with no external dependencies

## Expected Output

The test will show detailed progress through each logic test:

```
ðŸ”„ Starting Returning User Flow Logic Test
==================================================
ðŸ§ª Testing Returning User Flow Logic...

ðŸ“‹ Test 1: Authentication and Remember Me Logic
---------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ Test user: ReturningUser_1234567890
ðŸ’¾ Remember Me data created: ReturningUser_1234567890
âœ… Remember Me functionality working
âœ… Session restoration logic working
âœ… Authentication logic working correctly

ðŸ“‹ Test 2: Onboarding Status Determination Logic
---------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘¤ Checking onboarding status for user: ReturningUser_1234567890
ðŸ“Š Has momStage: false
ðŸ“Š Has questionSet1: true
ðŸ“Š Has questionSet2: false
ðŸ“Š Onboarding completed: false
âœ… Correctly identified incomplete onboarding
âœ… Correctly identified complete onboarding
âœ… Onboarding status logic working correctly

... (continues for all test cases)

âœ… All returning user flow logic tests completed!
ðŸŽ‰ Returning user flow logic is working correctly!
```

## What This Test Validates

### User Experience Improvements
- **Streamlined Onboarding**: Returning users skip redundant stage selection
- **Persistent Authentication**: Users stay logged in with "Remember Me"
- **Data Continuity**: User progress and preferences are maintained
- **Efficient Navigation**: Direct routing to appropriate screens

### Technical Functionality
- **Logic Validation**: Core decision-making algorithms
- **State Management**: Authentication and onboarding state logic
- **Flow Control**: Navigation decision patterns
- **Data Validation**: User completion status determination

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dart SDK Not Found**
   - Ensure Dart is installed and in your PATH
   - Try running `dart --version` to verify installation

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Run the script from the `v1_mother_edition` directory
   - Ensure you have execute permissions for the script

3. **Logic Errors**
   - Check the test output for specific assertion failures
   - Review the logic being tested against your app implementation

### Test Failure Analysis

If a test fails, check:
- The specific test case that failed
- Expected vs actual logic outcomes
- User state assumptions in your app logic
- Navigation decision patterns

## Integration with Existing Tests

This test complements the existing test suite:
- `simple_test.dart`: Tests core matching logic
- `test_matching_simple.dart`: Tests Firebase matching functionality  
- `test_returning_user_flow.dart`: Tests returning user flow logic (this test)

Together, these tests provide comprehensive coverage of the platform's core functionality through both logic validation and integration testing.
