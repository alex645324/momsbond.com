---

## Recent Changes (Current Session)

This session focused on implementing a comprehensive past connection system that allows users to reconnect with previous contacts while maintaining full conversation history, plus fixing critical bugs in the typing indicator and conversation management systems.

### 1. Text Configuration Updates ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/config/app_config.dart`

**Changes:**
- Updated chat input starter text from grief-focused to motherhood-focused:
  - **Before**: "Losing him broke something in me I've never talked about. I act strong, but underneath that I've been"
  - **After**: "Since becoming a mom, I feel like I've disappeared from my own story. Everyone asks about the baby, but no one asks about me. I've been"
- Updated both English and Spanish versions
- Added missing `relationshipChanges` and `relationshipChangesDb` constants that were causing compilation errors

### 2. Challenge Questions Fix ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/challenges_model.dart`

**Changes:**
- Fixed duplicate questions issue in Set 3 (trying to conceive stage)
- **Problem**: Set 3 had 4 constants but only 3 unique question texts, causing UI selection conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed the `relationship_changes` question from Set 3's `_set3Available` list
- **Result**: Set 3 now has exactly 3 distinct questions like Sets 1 & 2
- Kept constants in `app_config.dart` for backward compatibility

### 3. Real-Time Typing Indicator System ✅
**New Files Created:**
- `lib/Database_logic/typing_indicator_service.dart`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/messages_model.dart`
- `lib/viewmodels/messages_viewmodel.dart`
- `lib/Templates/chat_text_field.dart`
- `lib/views/messages_view.dart`

**Implementation Details:**

#### A. TypingIndicatorService
- **Purpose**: Manages real-time typing indicators via Firebase Firestore
- **Key Methods**:
  - `updateTypingStatus()`: Sets user's typing status
  - `getTypingStatusStream()`: Returns real-time stream of other users' typing statuses
  - `clearTypingStatus()`: Removes user's typing status
- **Features**:
  - Stale detection (filters statuses older than 3 seconds)
  - Automatic cleanup on errors
  - Real-time synchronization

#### B. MessagesModel Updates
- Added `typingStatus` field to track typing states per user
- Added `isOtherUserTyping` getter for UI display logic
- Updated constructor and `copyWith()` method

#### C. MessagesViewModel Integration
- Integrated TypingIndicatorService with existing chat functionality
- Added real-time typing status listener with proper cleanup
- **Focus-Based Logic**:
  - `onUserStartedTyping()`: Called when input field gains focus
  - `onUserStoppedTyping()`: Called when input field loses focus
  - Removed old text-based detection and 3-second auto-timeout

#### D. ChatTextField Enhancements
- Added focus state tracking with `_hasFocus` boolean
- Added typing detection callbacks in constructor
- **Focus Change Detection**: Automatically calls typing callbacks when focus changes
- **Height Change Tracking**: Added callback to notify when text field height changes
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing API

#### E. MessagesView UI Implementation
- **Animated Typing Indicator**: Custom `_TypingDot` widgets with staggered animations
- **Animation Timing**: 0ms, 200ms, and 400ms delays for smooth visual effect
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Typing indicator position adjusts based on text field height
- **Positioning Logic**: 
  - Uses `GlobalKey` to measure actual ChatTextField height
  - Updates position dynamically as text field expands/contracts
  - Always maintains proper spacing above input field

### 4. Dynamic Typing Indicator Positioning ✅
**Problem Solved:**
- Typing indicator appeared behind or overlapped text field for long messages
- Position was static and didn't account for multi-line text expansion

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Height Measurement**: Added `_updateTextFieldHeight()` method using `RenderBox`
- **Dynamic Updates**: Height recalculated on focus changes and text changes
- **Smart Positioning**: `bottom: (_textFieldHeight + 28) + bottomInset`
- **Real-time Adjustment**: Indicator repositions as user types and text field grows

---

## Technical Architecture

### Firebase Integration
- **Typing Status Storage**: `conversations/{conversationId}/typing/{userId}`
- **Real-time Sync**: Firestore snapshots for instant updates
- **Data Structure**:
  ```dart
  {
    'isTyping': boolean,
    'lastUpdated': timestamp
  }
  ```

### State Management
- **Provider Pattern**: MessagesViewModel extends ChangeNotifier
- **Stream Subscriptions**: Real-time listeners with proper cleanup
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic cleanup on dispose, conversation end, navigation

### UI/UX Features
- **Focus-Based Typing**: Shows indicator when input field is selected
- **Smooth Animations**: Staggered dot animations for natural feel
- **Responsive Design**: Dynamic positioning works across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard behavior

---

## Known Issues Resolved

### 1. Compilation Errors ✅
- **Issue**: Missing `ChallengeTexts.relationshipChanges` constants
- **Root Cause**: Constants were accidentally removed during challenge questions update
- **Fix**: Re-added constants to both English and Spanish sections in `app_config.dart`

### 2. Duplicate Question Selection ✅
- **Issue**: In Set 3, selecting one question automatically selected another
- **Root Cause**: Multiple question IDs mapped to identical text content
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate question from Set 3 question list

### 3. Typing Indicator Positioning ✅
- **Issue**: Indicator appeared behind text field or overlapped for long messages
- **Root Cause**: Static positioning didn't account for dynamic text field height
- **Fix**: Implemented dynamic height measurement and positioning

### 4. Typing Indicator Reliability ✅
- **Issue**: Typing indicator only worked once, then stopped appearing
- **Root Cause**: Text-based detection with complex state management
- **Fix**: Switched to focus-based detection with simplified state tracking

### 5. Past Connection History Not Loading ✅
- **Issue**: Users couldn't see conversation history when reconnecting with past connections
- **Root Cause**: System was creating new conversation IDs instead of reusing existing ones
- **Fix**: Modified reconnection flow to reuse existing conversation IDs from original matches

### 6. Past Connection Timer Issues ✅
- **Issue**: Past connections loaded conversation history but ended immediately instead of starting fresh timer
- **Root Cause**: Conversation documents had `isActive: false` from previous sessions, triggering immediate termination
- **Fix**: Added conversation reactivation logic for past connections to reset `isActive: true`

### 7. isPastConnection Detection Failure ✅
- **Issue**: Past connection detection logic was unreliable, causing wrong behavior
- **Root Cause**: Detection based on `conversationId.isNotEmpty` was always true after conversation ID fixes
- **Fix**: Changed detection to use `matchData['sessionType'] == 'reconnection'` for accurate identification

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **No Comments**: Code is self-documenting unless explicitly requested
- **Existing Patterns**: Follow established MVVM architecture and Provider patterns
- **Library Usage**: Only use libraries already present in the project
- **Security**: Never expose or commit secrets/keys

### Testing Commands
- **Lint**: Run `flutter analyze` to check code quality
- **Build**: Run `flutter build web --base-href /momsbond.com/` for GitHub Pages deployment

### Git Workflow
- **Commits**: Only commit when explicitly requested by user
- **Branch**: Currently working on `emotion` branch
- **Main Branch**: `master` (used for PRs)

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Typing Indicator Customization**: User-specific colors or styles
- **Message Status**: Read receipts, delivery confirmations
- **Performance**: Optimize Firestore queries for larger conversations
- **Offline Support**: Handle typing indicators when offline

### Monitoring
- **Performance**: Monitor typing indicator Firestore usage
- **User Experience**: Track focus-based typing adoption
- **Error Handling**: Monitor cleanup and lifecycle management

### 5. Past Connection Conversation History System ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/messages_model.dart`
- `lib/viewmodels/messages_viewmodel.dart` 
- `lib/viewmodels/dashboard_viewmodel.dart`
- `lib/Templates/chat_text_field.dart`
- `lib/Database_logic/simple_matching.dart`
- `lib/Database_logic/invitation_manager.dart`
- `lib/models/dashboard_model.dart`

**Implementation Details:**

#### A. Past Connection Detection and Flow
- **Past vs New Connection Logic**: Added `isPastConnection` flag to `ConversationInitData`
- **Detection Method**: Uses `sessionType: 'reconnection'` from match document to identify past connections
- **Conversation History**: Past connections load up to 1000 messages vs 50 for new connections
- **UI Behavior**: Past connections hide prewritten starter text and show full conversation history

#### B. Conversation ID Management
- **Storage**: Added `conversationId` field to match documents in Firestore for consistent reuse
- **Reuse Logic**: Past connections reuse original conversation ID to maintain message history
- **Fallback Strategy**: Uses match ID as conversation ID for older matches without stored `conversationId`
- **Match Document Structure**:
  ```dart
  {
    'conversationId': matchRef.id, // For reuse in reconnections
    'sessionType': 'reconnection', // For past connection detection
    // ... other match fields
  }
  ```

#### C. Conversation Document Reactivation
- **Problem**: Past connections loaded with `isActive: false` causing immediate termination
- **Solution**: Reactivate conversation documents for past connections
- **Implementation**: 
  ```dart
  if (initData.isPastConnection) {
    await conversationRef.update({
      'isActive': true,
      'reactivatedAt': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    });
  }
  ```

#### D. Invitation System Updates
- **Conversation ID Preservation**: Modified `InvitationManager` to accept `existingConversationId`
- **Reconnection Matches**: Creates temporary match documents that reference original conversation IDs
- **Match Cleanup**: Properly handles temporary reconnection matches while preserving original data

#### E. UI Integration
- **ChatTextField**: Conditionally shows/hides prewritten text based on `isPastConnection` flag
- **Message Loading**: Different message limits (1000 vs 50) based on connection type
- **Conversation Flow**: Identical timer and interaction behavior for both connection types

### 6. Conversation History Bug Fixes ✅
**Critical Issues Resolved:**

#### A. Conversation ID Mismatch Issue
- **Problem**: Reconnections generated new conversation IDs instead of reusing original ones
- **Root Cause**: `_generateConversationId()` created unique timestamps causing ID mismatch
- **Fix**: Modified `_createReconnectionMatch()` to use `originalData['conversationId'] ?? originalMatchId`

#### B. isPastConnection Detection Failure  
- **Problem**: `connection.conversationId.isNotEmpty` was always true after fixing conversation IDs
- **Root Cause**: All connections had conversation IDs, making detection logic ineffective
- **Fix**: Changed detection to use `matchData['sessionType'] == 'reconnection'`

#### C. Conversation Document State Issues
- **Problem**: Past connections loaded old documents with `isActive: false` causing immediate termination
- **Root Cause**: Previous conversation sessions left documents in inactive state
- **Fix**: Added conversation reactivation logic in `_createConversationDocument()`

#### D. Message History Loading
- **Problem**: Past connections showing only recent messages instead of full history
- **Root Cause**: All conversations used 50-message limit regardless of connection type  
- **Fix**: Dynamic message limits based on `isPastConnection` flag (1000 vs 50 messages)

---

## Advanced Technical Architecture

### Past Connection Flow
1. **User clicks past connection** → Dashboard creates reconnection match with `sessionType: 'reconnection'`
2. **Invitation sent** → InvitationManager preserves original `conversationId`
3. **Invitation accepted** → MessagesViewModel detects `isPastConnection = true`
4. **Conversation loads** → Reactivates document, loads full history, hides starter text
5. **Fresh timer starts** → 5-minute session with complete conversation context

### Conversation State Management
- **New Conversations**: Fresh document with `isActive: true`, 50-message limit, starter text shown
- **Past Connections**: Reactivated document, 1000-message history, no starter text, preserved conversation ID
- **Timer Behavior**: Both get identical 5-minute sessions with proper cleanup

### Database Schema Updates
```dart
// Match documents now include
{
  'conversationId': 'matchId', // For conversation continuity
  'sessionType': 'reconnection', // For past connection detection  
  'originalMatchId': 'parentId', // For temporary reconnection matches
  'isReconnection': true, // Flag for cleanup processes
}

// Conversation documents include  
{
  'isActive': true, // Reactivated for past connections
  'reactivatedAt': timestamp, // Track reactivation events
}
```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Missing conversation IDs**: Graceful fallback to match ID
- **Orphaned temporary matches**: Automatic cleanup system
- **Concurrent reconnections**: Proper state management and conflict resolution
- **Session interruptions**: Robust cleanup and state recovery
